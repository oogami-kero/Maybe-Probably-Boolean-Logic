# Maybe-Probably-Boolean-Logic
CS2050 Assignment Fall 2020

Maybe-Probably Logic
Program to test student understanding by using binary trees, stacks, unittest, and random.

Assignment task: implement build, evaluate, and print functions for our language of maybe-probably logical statement

The primary tasks in this fourth assignment are to implement the following three functions:
1. buildMPLogicParseTree(s) - this function should take a string as input (e.g. s = '( T OR P_0.9 )') and should return the binary tree representing the parse tree as described in class
2. evaluateMPLogicParseTree(t) - this function should take a binary tree as input and should return a T or an F that is based on the on the input statement
3. printMPLogicExpression(t) - this function should take a binary tree as input and should return the string that looks like the original string (perhaps with extra parentheses)
4. create some examples of how your functions work (inside of def main()), and test that each of the functions works correctly (using unittest)
